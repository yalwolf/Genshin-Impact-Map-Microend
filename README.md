<h1>Genshin Impact Map Microend PC</h1>

## Version
<p>v2.3 Updated the installation interface</p>
<p>-- Optimized for slow loading</p>

## Annotation
<p>This is the official map tool, there is no secondary repair</p>
<p>This project was made when I was bored. There is no cool GUI. </p>
<p>The principle is: a small window made with node.js and a website to load official tools.</p>
